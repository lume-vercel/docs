# <code>class <b>Points</b> extends [Element3D](..\core\Element3D.md)</code> :id=Points

Element: `<lume-points>`

Applies default behaviors of
[`box-geometry`](../behaviors/mesh-behaviors/geometries/BoxGeometryBehavior)
and
[`points-material`](../behaviors/mesh-behaviors/materials/PhongMaterialBehavior).

A `<lume-points>` element is similar to a `<lume-mesh>` element, except that
the `points-material` is used by default, which renders any geometry's
verticies as points instead of filled triangles.

It can be useful to have
[`ply-geometry`](../behaviors/mesh-behaviors/geometries/PlyGeometryBehavior)
behavior on this element to load a set of points from a file for example.
