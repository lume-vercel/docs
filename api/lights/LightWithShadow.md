# <code>class <b>LightWithShadow</b> extends [Light](Light.md)</code> :id=LightWithShadow

`abstract`

An abstract base class for light elements that can cast shadows, such as
[PointLight](./PointLight), [SpotLight](./SpotLight), and
[DirectionalLight](./DirectionalLight).

Lights that can have shadows have a shadow camera for shadow projection. The
camera can be a perspective camera or an orthographic camera depending on the
type of light. The properties in this class are common for either type of
shadow camera.

## Properties

Inherits properties from [Light](Light.md).


### <code>.<b>castShadow</b></code> :id=castShadow

`attribute`

Default: `true`

When `true` a light will cast dynamic shadows from objects that cast
shadow onto objects that receive shadow.

Note: Lights are expensive (requires rendering the scene once per light),
and qill require adjustments to a light's shadow camera to get it right
and to avoid shadow on unnecessary objects. By default, all objects cast
and receive shadows, but it can be useful to turn off shadow features for
objects that don't need shadow features to get more performance (f.e. see
[`Mesh.castShadow`](../meshes/Mesh#castShadow) and
[`Mesh.receiveShadow`](../meshes/Mesh#receiveShadow)).
        


### <code>.<b>shadowMapWidth</b></code> :id=shadowMapWidth

`attribute`

Default: `512`

The width of the shadow map used for projecting shadows.

Higher values give better quality shadows at the cost of computation
time. Values must be powers of 2 (256, 512, 1024, etc), up to the
[`WebGLRenderer.capabilities.maxTextureSize`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=lightshadow#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer.capabilities)
for a given device, although the width and height don't have to be the
same (for example (512, 1024) is valid).
        


### <code>.<b>shadowMapHeight</b></code> :id=shadowMapHeight

`attribute`

Default: `512`

The height of the shadow map used for projecting shadows.

Higher values give better quality shadows at the cost of computation
time. Values must be powers of 2 (256, 512, 1024, etc), up to the
[`WebGLRenderer.capabilities.maxTextureSize`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=lightshadow#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer.capabilities)
for a given device, although the width and height don't have to be the
same (for example (512, 1024) is valid).
        


### <code>.<b>shadowRadius</b></code> :id=shadowRadius

`attribute`

Default: `3`

Setting this to values greater than `1` will blur the edges of the shadow.
High values will cause unwanted banding effects in the shadows - a
greater width and height of the shadow map will allow for a higher radius
to be used before these effects become visible.

When [Scene.shadowmapType](../core/Scene#shadowmapType) is set to
`"pcfsoft"`, the radius has no effect and it is recommended to increase
softness by decreasing the shadow map width and height instead.

When [Scene.shadowmapType](../core/Scene#shadowmapType) is set to
`"basic"`, radius also has no effect, and there is no further way to
adjust shadow softness.
        


### <code>.<b>shadowBias</b></code> :id=shadowBias

`attribute`

Default: `0`

Shadow bias adjusts the depth of a shadow pixel, which is useful for
avoiding shadow rendering artifacts (f.e. "shadow acne" when a
surface both creates and receives a shadow on itself). Very tiny
adjustments (in the order of 0.0001) may help reduce these artifacts..

This topic is too complex to explain in a paragraph. Here are several
nice resources for understanding this:

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dxtecharts/common-techniques-to-improve-shadow-depth-maps
        


### <code>.<b>shadowNormalBias</b></code> :id=shadowNormalBias

`attribute`

Default: `0`

This is similarly useful for the same reason as
[`shadowBias`](#shadowBias) in preventing visual self-shadowing
artifacts. This moves shadow pixels into a surface based on the surface
normal.

Increasing this value can be used to reduce shadow acne especially in
large scenes where light shines onto geometry at a shallow angle. The
downside is that shadows may appear warped with larger values.
        


### <code>.<b>shadowCameraNear</b></code> :id=shadowCameraNear

`attribute`

Default: `1`

Adjusts the near plane of the internal camera used for shadow projection.
        


### <code>.<b>shadowCameraFar</b></code> :id=shadowCameraFar

`attribute`

Default: `2000`

Adjusts the far plane of the internal camera used for shadow projection.
